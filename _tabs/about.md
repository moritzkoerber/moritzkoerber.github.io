Hey! I am Moritz, a data engineer based in Munich (Germany). I like coding in Python and PySpark, doing stats and plots in R, and hanging around on AWS. I blog here about things that I come across on my journey. If you want to get in touch or meet for some fine coffee in Munich, just send me a <a href="mailto:moritzjkoerber@gmail.com">mail</a> or use one of the many buttons on the bottom left ;)
