Hey! I am Moritz, a data scientist based in Munich (Germany). I did my [PhD](https://mediatum.ub.tum.de/doc/1432904/1432904.pdf) in human factors psychology at the Technical University of Munich, where I also taught statistics. Currently, I am working as a full-stack data scientist at tadoÂ°. At my computer, I like coding in Python and PySpark, doing stats and plots in R, and hanging around on AWS. I am blogging here about things that I come across on my journey. If you want to get in touch or meet for a coffee in Munich, just send me a <a href="mailto:moritzjkoerber@gmail.com">mail</a> or use one of the many buttons on the bottom left ;)
