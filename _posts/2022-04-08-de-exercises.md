Yesterday, I finished the last exercise of Daniel Beach's amazing [data engineering exercises](https://github.com/danielbeach/data-engineering-practice). The exercises look simple at first glance, but in each exercise I stumbled upon something of which I thought I had mastered it, when in reality I had to give it some thought. Here are my [solutions](https://github.com/moritzkoerber/data-engineering-practice).

A little bonus motivation for anyone to tackle them, too: Daniel sends you a free copy of his [book](https://leanpub.com/dataengineeringwithpython/) if you show him a repo with all exercises solved!
